# Diabetes_prediction
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting diabetes using machine learning techniques. The project includes:

Data Loading and Exploration: Preparing and analyzing the dataset for training.
Feature Engineering: Handling missing values, scaling, and selecting important features.
Model Training and Evaluation: Using machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) to predict diabetes outcomes.
Visualization: Plotting insights and results for better interpretability.
